# Reet Work Directory

1) Week 1: 2/5/2024 - 2/11/2024
- TA Meeting 2/6
- Worked on the Proposal and submitted it
- Worked on the team contract 

3) Week 2: 2/12/2024 - 2/18/2024
- TA Meeting 2/13
- Discussed with machine shop about the motor and handle system 2/15
- Started ordering the first stepper motor for trial and then a shower handle for the setup to start the project
- Met with the team and discusses about what our RFA/ Project Proposal would need aligning with the Design Document
- Reserved a ESP-32 Microcontroller Devkit to start the project
- Discussed about how a pulley system may not make sense and to implement a motor instead to help with the mechanics

3) Week 3: 2/19/2024 - 2/25/2024
- TA Meeting 2/20
- Discussed the steps behind how we want to start the PCB Design
- Decided to split up the PCB design based on subsystems
- I decided to work on the stepper motor/driver portion on the schematic and the schematic design for the linear actuator
- In terms of splitting the testing for the entire project, we did this by the subsystems again and working together, I was focused on helping with the motor subsystem and the linear actuator subsystem.
- Worked on the Design Document
- Reworked the proposal with the feedback provided 
- Started working towards the Design Review and PCB design

4) Week 4: 2/26/2024 - 3/3/2024
- Design Review 2/27
- Worked on the PCB design looking at datasheets and informed the team of what we may need to order component wise
- Found out we would need a motor driver to allow the stepper motor to be able to drive
- Worked with the team on how to figure out the DevKit and how to burn bootloader etc. 

5) Week 5: 3/4/2024 - 3/10/2024
- TA Meeting 3/5
- Worked on Teamwork Evaluation 1
- Decided to work towards the Second Round of PCBway orders
- Worked with the team on programming the ESP with the temperature sensor, figured out that it can read a 16-bit value and can be displayed either in Fahrenheit or Celsius
- Discussed with machine shop for any changes in our physical design

6) Spring Break 3/11/2024 - 3/17/2024
- Still working on the design of our PCB, we decided that the first draft was done but we each individually wanted to research into the correct components and schematic based implementation so we could debug what we needed to do
- Connected during Spring Break online to fix any thing and see that our PCB passes the audit and decided as a team and discussing with our TA that 2nd round order is where we will request for our design implementation.

7) Week 6: 3/18/2024 - 3/24/2024
- TA Meeting 3/19
- Ordered the PCB in the 2nd Round
- Started testing the motor and how to integrate with the ESP with the team
- Picked up the shower handle from the machine shop
- Found out that our driver and the motor on the physical design from shop are not compatible, so as a team we decided to swap it with a motor that coordinates with the driver we have.

8) Week 7: 3/25/2024 - 3/31/2024
- TA Meeting 3/26
- Worked on the motor integration for the physical design
- Worked on the individual progress reports
- worked on design doc revisions for regrade
- The team and I swapped out the motor on the handle with another one compatible with our driver after disccussing with shop
- Worked on integrating with the temperature and the motor and for it to move with corresponding temp readings and steps. (this took alot of time to debug and test in general)

9) Week 8: 4/1/2024 - 4/7/2024
- TA Meeting 4/2
- Our team found out that the PCB from Round 2 was cancelled from course staff
- Emailed Jason and Nikhil to make revisions and was informed about moving forward from course staff on ordering separately
- Saw that our subsystems were working fine, linear actuator did not have time to fully function since we decided to test it on the pcb because keeping mind of our budget it would not make sense to buy a driver for breadboard.
- We stated a list of components after our separate order to start buying. 

10) Week 9: 4/8/2024 - 4/14/2024
- TA Meeting 4/9
- We were informed about our PCB tracking
- I ordered the 12 components we need, and requested the TA for the other components
- We can start soldering once PCB arrives and components come.

11) Week 10: 4/15/2024 - 4/21/2024
- TA Meeting 4/16/2024
- PCB came in and soldered the parts that also came in.
- Prepped for Mock Demo
- Completed team contract fulfillment
- Had to reorder some components which did not match
- Did not programm ESP yet since we were waiting on buttons and USBC-receptacle
- Demnonstrated working subsystems on breadboard
- Realized our PCB does not work due to buck converter not being able to send 3.3V

12) Week 11: 4/22/2024 - 4/28/2024
- Final Demo
- Mock Presentation
- Prepared for final demo and made final video for extra credit
- Prepared slides for mock/final presentation which we got feedback for
- Working on preparing for final presentation
- Finishing final papers
- Kept in mind of lab checkout
