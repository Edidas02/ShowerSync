## TA Meeting 1 2/13/2024

  Discussed what we need to revise for our project proposal in lieu of the design document. Reserved a ESP-32 Microcontroller for project use later. Revised plan to swap pulley system for simple motor/hook

## Machine Shop 2/15/2024  

Talked to machine shop about motor/handle system. Ordered a trial stepper motor and a shower handle for testing.

## TA Meeting 2 2/20/2024

Discussed next steps of PCB design. Split up subsystems to each person. Currently, I am in charge of the power and temperature subsystem as well as integrating the motor subsystem later. Started working on basic PCB schematic.

## TA Meeting 3 2/27/2024

Continue to work on PCB. Ordered a motor driver package to test different motor since we gave the machine shop our original motor. As of right now, we are still trying to figure out the settings to program our ESP. Once we finish that, we can begin writing driver code.

## TA Meeting 4 3/5/2024

Still routing our PCB. We should be able to make it by the 2nd order deadline. Finished programming the ESP and fully integrated the temperature sensor. As of right now, our temperature sensor can read a 16-bit value and output it as a temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit.

## Mid-week update

We finished the first design of our PCB. We still have to debug any problems if they arise, but the first draft is done.

## Spring break

PCB passes audit and we plan on ordering on the 2nd round. 

## TA Meeting 5 3/18/2024

Ordered PCB in 2nd round. Working on integrating the motor with ESP. Received finished shower handle product from machine shop. As of right now, the motor on the handle is not working with our driver, so we are most likely going to swap it out with a motor that works.

## TA Meeting 6 3/25/2024

Motor integration is complete. Swapped out motor on handle with one that works. Also integrated temperature with the motor so the handle moves depending on the temperature reading.

## TA Meeting 7 4/2/2024

We found out our PCB order was cancelled, so we have made more revisions to order again separately. All of our individual subsystems work fine and motor/temperature is already integrated. We have to order some more PCB parts that are not available in the shop.

## TA Meeting 4/9/2024

PCB should be almost here. Not many updates since all we have left is to solder the PCB and we need to wait for everything to come.

## TA Meeting 4/16/2024

Our PCB came in and we soldered the parts that we have as of right now. Some parts didn't match so we had to reorder some components. We still have not programmed our ESP on the PCB since we are missing buttons and a USB-C receptacle that we ordered incorrectly. We also had our mock demo in which we demonstrated our working subsystems on a breadboard.
